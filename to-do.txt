Next tasks:
- Figure out auth issues and get it connected to authlib
- add website attributes: nav, back buttons n such
- Save photo functionality that saves something cool
- Some sort of playlist-making functionality or other cool interactiveness from the plot
- filter system (take a playlist or maybe start with the db), allow you to change aspects 
and have it produce those songs in a list with an option to visualize
- Ability to view all your songs and then produce clusters based on values (display clusters)
- Confidence rating for recommended songs? If below a threshold, don't recommend 
    - Similarly, increase or lower threshold for song recommendations based on the defined clusters and trends (and number of songs, ability to detect variance)
    - Change axes depending on the three most valuable attributes
- Add song to playlist action
- Add all liked songs to the .db (slow load)
- Would it be possible to attach songs added to a particular person/people and their profile such that recommended songs only come from
people who have a similar profile to you? That way there isn't contamination from non-similar profiles and each song recommended to you
may come from someone you would want to interact with
- Pulsing background color?
